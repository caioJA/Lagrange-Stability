# [Lagrange-Stability](https://caioja.github.io/Lagrange-Stability/)
This code simulates the trajectories of many bodies of neglectible mass in the Sun-Jupiter system, that begin their orbits near the theoretically stable Lagrange points. 
After sufficient time passes, it is possible to see that some of the infinitesimal bodies are trapped in the stability regions. 
You can see the simulation [here!](https://caioja.github.io/Lagrange-Stability/)
